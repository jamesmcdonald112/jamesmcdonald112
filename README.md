### Hi there 👋

# James McDonald's Software Development Portfolio

## Description
Welcome to my academic portfolio, showcasing a selection of Java applications I've developed at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. Here, you'll find everything from encryption algorithms to network communication systems, each reflecting my education in software development.

## Highlighted Repositories
- [Sentiment Analysis with Virtual Threads](https://github.com/jamesmcdonald112/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Virtual-Threads)
- [Java Network Chat using Socket API](https://github.com/jamesmcdonald112/Java-Network-Chat-SocketAPI)
- [File Encryption using 2D Arrays](https://github.com/jamesmcdonald112/File-Encryption-using-2D-Arrays)


## Upcoming Modules 🌱
As I continue my studies, I look forward to diving into Computational Thinking with Algorithms, Database Design and Development, and Web Applications Development. I'm excited to learn the associated technologies and languages. Stay tuned for new projects!

## Current Interests 🤔
I am dedicated to mastering the fundamentals of software development. With each project, I aim to strengthen a different facet of my coding skills, always seeking to learn and grow.

## Challenges Overcome 🏔️
Navigating the complexities of Java's virtual threads has been among my latest conquests, significantly improving my problem-solving toolkit.

## Professional Aspirations 🎯
I aim to become deeply knowledgeable in programming, earn a wealth of certifications, and engage with meaningful projects at a company whose vision resonates.

## Community Engagement 👐
While I still need to become active in software development communities, I'm open to opportunities that align with my passion for growth and collaboration.

## A Note on Music 🎵
I am a music teacher music, have a first-class honours degree in the subject, play classical guitar and piano, have been awarded first prize in three competitions, and continue my studies in classical composition. The discipline and creativity in music parallel the skills necessary for innovative software development.
